/*
Given a list of matches in the group stage of the football World Cup, compute the number of points each team currently has.
You are given two tables, “teams” and “matches”, with the following structures:

The scoring rules are as follows:
•	If a team wins a match (scores strictly more goals than the other team), it receives three points.
•	If a team draws a match (scores exactly the same number of goals as the opponent), it receives one point.
•	If a team loses a match (scores fewer goals than the opponent), it receives no points.

Write an SQL query that returns a ranking of all teams (“team_id”) described in the “teams” table.
For each team, you should provide its name and the number of points it received after all described matches (“num_points”). 
The table should be ordered by “num_points” (in decreasing order). In case of a tie, order the rows by “team_id” (in increasing order).
