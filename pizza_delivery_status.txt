-- Pizza Delivery Status 

-- A pizza company is taking orders from customers, and each pizza ordered is added to their database as a separate order.
-- Each order has an associated status, "CREATED or SUBMITTED or DELIVERED'. 
-- An order's Final_ Status is calculated based on status as follows:
	1. When all orders for a customer have a status of DELIVERED, that customer's order has a Final_Status of COMPLETED.
	2. If a customer has some orders that are not DELIVERED and some orders that are DELIVERED, the Final_ Status is IN PROGRESS.
	3. If all of a customer's orders are SUBMITTED, the Final_Status is AWAITING PROGRESS.
	4. Otherwise, the Final Status is AWAITING SUBMISSION.
Write a query to report the customer_name and Final_Status of each customer's arder. Order the results by customer
